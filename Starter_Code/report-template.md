## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to build machine learning models for credit risk prediction based on historical lending activity data from a peer-to-peer lending services company. The goal is to identify the creditworthiness of borrowers, with a focus on predicting whether a loan is healthy (0) or has a high risk of default (1).

The financial information in the dataset includes various features such as loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt-to-income ratio, number of accounts, derogatory marks, total debt, and loan status.

The target variable for prediction is the "loan_status" column, where a value of 0 indicates a healthy loan, and a value of 1 indicates a high-risk loan. A brief exploration using `value_counts` indicates the balance or imbalance between healthy and high-risk loans.

The machine learning process involves the following stages:
1. **Data Loading and Exploration:** Reading the dataset, separating features and labels, and exploring label balance.
2. **Model Training (Original Data):** Building a logistic regression model with the original data and evaluating its performance.
3. **Resampling (Random Oversampling):** Using the imbalanced-learn library to resample the training data for better model performance.
4. **Model Training (Resampled Data):** Building a logistic regression model with the resampled data and evaluating its performance.

## Summary

The results indicate that the logistic regression model trained on resampled data performs better in terms of balanced accuracy, precision, and recall compared to the model trained on the original data. The resampling technique, specifically random oversampling, helps address the imbalance in the dataset, leading to improved predictions for both healthy and high-risk loans.

The choice of the model may depend on the specific problem being addressed. If the goal is to have a balanced prediction for both healthy and high-risk loans, the model trained on resampled data is recommended. However, it's crucial to consider the problem context, as the importance of predicting healthy loans versus high-risk loans may vary based on business objectives.

In summary, the logistic regression model with resampled data is recommended for its balanced performance, but stakeholders should carefully consider the problem context and priorities when making a final decision. If none of the models meet the desired criteria or if business requirements change, further exploration and model refinement may be necessary.
